optional screenshot upload. Transactions can be marked as Given or Taken.
2. Account Linking System
Profiles for each giver/receiver with interlinked transactions showing total outstanding
balances and automatic adjustments.
3. Interest Calculation Module
Automatic interest calculation (monthly/yearly), support for simple or compound interest, and
handling of partial payments or extensions.
4. Reminder & Notification System
Smart pop-up reminders for upcoming and due payments, with scope for
Email/SMS/WhatsApp notifications in future versions.
5. Dashboard & Reporting

PDF/Excel reports.
Additional Features (Future Upgrades):
Role-based authentication, backup and restore options, AI-based reminders, and accounting
API integration.
